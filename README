# About gnox

gnox is a command-line utility that notifies user about the changes in their
GMail mailbox. The main advantage of gnox is that it uses XMPP to fetch new
mail notifications unlike the other similar programs basically using POP3 or
IMAP and rarely Atom feed. The crucial part of this approach is that the
notifications are pushed by the server and hence the mailbox status is updated
almost immediately.

# Running gnox

1. Read gnoxrc.example first and create `.gnoxrc` with required fields.
2. Run Gnox as a regular script.
3. Gnox requires `xmpp` python module. In Ubuntu it can be
installed as `apt-get install python-xmpp -y`.
