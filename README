About gnox
==========

gnox is a command-line utility that notifies user about the changes in his
GMail mailbox. The main advantage of gnox is that it uses XMPP to fetch new
mail notifications unlike the other similar programs basically using POP3 or
IMAP and rarely Atom feed. The crucial part of this approach is that the
notifications are pushed by the server and hence the mailbox status is updated
almost immediately.
